            <h3 class="firstP"> I received a job offer mid-course and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h3>
            <p> "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I have been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intor course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I have successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer in a VR startup."</p>

The program gave me the confidence necessay to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.

            <p> "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionalswho can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. Infact, I have often referred to it during my interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"</p>
